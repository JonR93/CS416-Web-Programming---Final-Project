# CS416-Web-Programming---Final-Project
A basic social media web app where users post messages for others to view.

For the project the core functionality requirements below must be either JSF or Spring MVC (or a mix of both).  You may use any other technology/architecture/framework you want to enhance your application outside of these requirements if you like.

The core requirements listed below are meant as a bare minimum.  My expectation is that you will use what you have learned throughout the semester to demonstrate mastery of the material in making a dynamic web application.  By this I mean that your project isn’t a bunch of disconnected pages, but rather an integrated data driven application using the MVC architecture.

Core requirements:
•	JPA entity beans for the model with at least one mapping of either many-to-many or one-to-many
o	Through application at least one place where you demonstrate understanding of each of these: create, update, delete, find (does not have to be same place)
•	A complex flow element – a place where hitting “submit” on the page could take you one of several possible locations and the location must be determined by business logic (Class example was loan status determining whether to ask for more information about people, or home, or submit and save and show confirmation)
•	Use of validation both built in and custom validation through your chosen framework (i.e. JSF or Spring)
•	AJAX 
•	Good MVC practices
